Config file `config_0.770.yaml` is for the system that we achieved `F1@0.05=0.770` on Kinetics-GEBD val dataset. To train the model with this config, edit DATA_DIR and OUT_DIR, then run the following command:
```
python main.py --cfg config/config_0.770.yaml
```
The corresponding checkpoint for this run can be found in [this link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1vAV7qfZd0eP5W8esgo84Yn0Al2uzyBYQ/view?usp=share_link).
